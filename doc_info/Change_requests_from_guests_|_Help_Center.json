Below is an overview of how changes are handled across our booking channels, and how the care team is involved. Types of reservation changesGuests can request different types of changes to their reservation:- Change dates (including adding or removing nights)\n- Change guest count\n- Add or remove pets\n- Cancel reservationReservation changes by booking channelFor Airbnb, Fairly has an automated system that handles most simple changes, while Vrbo requires more hands-on involvement from caretakers or homeowners. <b>Airbnb</b>- Guests must request changes directly through the Airbnb app and website.\n- Fairly automatically processes simple requests (e.g., adding pets or nights during refundable periods) and flags complex ones (e.g., date reductions outside refundable periods) for caretaker/homeowner review.<b>Vrbo</b>- Guests send free-form messages to the Caretaker to request changes.\n- Caretakers or homeowners follow the prompts to change the reservation in Fairly.\n- Note: Guests can cancel their reservation directly through Vrbo before check-in, without care team involvement. What is the caretaker/homeowner role when a guest changes a reservation?AirbnbMost change requests from guests are simple date changes or adding guests. Instead of having to review each request, we\u2019ve streamlined the process based on Airbnb\u2019s cancellation policy <b>and</b> the type of change requested. Automatic approvals \u2013 no action neededSome changes are automatically approved and do <b>not</b> require any response from the homeowner or caretaker. You\u2019ll see the update reflected in your Messages tab.- <b>The guest is within the 100% refund window.</b><br>(Regardless of the change type.)\n- <b>The guest changes occupancy.</b><br>(As long as it does not exceed your allowed guest maximum.)\n- <b>The guest adds or removes pets.</b><br>(As long as it stays within your pet policy.) Requires your review \u2013 action neededIf the guest's change request <b>is outside the 100% refund period</b> <i>and</i> does not fall into the list above, we will notify you. You\u2019ll receive an SMS alert and can review and accept/decline the request in Fairly. ExamplesHere are some examples of when change requests for <b>Airbnb</b> reservations are automatically accepted or require your review:It's important to know that when you accept changes that affect the check-in date, that the cancellation policy is now based on the new date.  Learn more about cancelation policies <b><a href=\"https://support.fairly.com/en/articles/9750421-cancellation-policies\">here</a></b>. What happens if you don\u2019t respond to the request?It is important that the homeowner or caretaker responds <b>within 24 hours, </b>so that your listing\u2019s ranking is not penalized by Airbnb. It is great customer service to respond to all guest requests so we encourage you to let the guest know your decision. If you do not respond, then the original reservation stays the same. VrboSince VRBO does not provide self-service tools for guests to make changes, such as adjusting dates or the number of guests, these updates must be handled through Fairly. Remember, you can decline requests if necessary. If the guest\u2019s request does not align with your cancellation policy or other rules, you can choose to decline it. Communicate clearly with the guest to explain the decision. Changing a Vrbo reservationYou can make updates to a guest\u2019s Vrbo reservation anytime \u2014 it just takes a few clicks.<br>\u200b<b>To make a change:</b>1. Open the <b>Reservation details</b>.\n2. Click <b>Change reservation</b> and follow the prompts.You\u2019ll see a quick preview of any price difference before submitting.<b>If the change increases the cost:</b>- Fairly automatically messages the guest with a link to pay for the difference.\n- The change isn\u2019t final until the guest completes that payment.<b>If the change lowers the cost:</b>- A refund will be issued automatically to the guest\u2019s original payment method within 7\u201310 business days.\n- No extra steps are needed.That\u2019s it \u2014 once payment (or refund) is complete, the updated reservation will be confirmed for both you and the guest.  FAQs- Can I transfer a reservation to another guest?\n  - No, reservations must be canceled and rebooked by the new guest.- What happens if a reservation needs to be canceled after check-in?\n  - Caretakers can initiate cancellations for emergencies through Fairly, and refunds will be issued based on the remaining stay and cancellation policy.- What penalties apply for caretaker-initiated cancellations?\n  - Airbnb and Vrbo impose penalties, including fees and blocked availability.
