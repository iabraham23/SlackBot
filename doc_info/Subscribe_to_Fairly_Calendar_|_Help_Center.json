  "article": "You can create a subscription link (ICS format) to your Fairly reservation calendar. This allows third parties, such as service providers, family members, or anyone else you choose, to view reservation dates in their own calendar apps (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.). The person subscribing does not need a Fairly account. They simply add the ICS link you provide to their preferred calendar app, and the reservations will appear as a separate calendar titled: <i>Fairly: [Your Home\u2019s Address] Reservations</i> This is a read only subscription. It does not give them access to your Fairly account, and they cannot edit your calendar. Events will be labeled as:- <b>Owner reservation</b> (when you\u2019ve booked time in your home yourself)\n- <b>Guest reservation</b> (when a guest is staying)Guest names are never shared.
