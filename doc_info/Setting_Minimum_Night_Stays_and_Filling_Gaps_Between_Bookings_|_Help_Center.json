  "article": "You have flexible controls over how many nights guests are required to stay at your home. Whether you want to set a general rule, make exceptions for holidays and weekends, or allow guests to fill small gaps in your calendar, you can do it all from your Fairly dashboard. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 3 main controls you have:___________________________________________________________1. <b>Default Minimum Stay (All dates)</b>This is the number of nights guests must book when reserving your home. It applies to <b>all dates by default</b>, unless you set custom rules (see #3 below).- <b>Where to adjust it:</b> Go to the <b>Listings</b> section of your dashboard, and <b>Access &amp; Policies</b>.\n- <b>Default setting:</b> It defaults to 2 nights, but you can change it to meet your needs\u2014e.g., 1 night if you want more bookings.\n- <b>Example:</b> If your default is 4 nights, guests won\u2019t be able to book stays shorter than that unless a short gap rule applies (see next section).___________________________________________________________2. <b>Fill Short Gaps Between Bookings</b>Have a 1 or 2 night gap between two longer bookings? You can choose to allow guests to book those shorter stays\u2014even if they\u2019re below your default or custom minimum stay.- <b>Tip:</b> We recommend enabling this because it is great for maximizing occupancy without reducing your general minimum stay.\n- <b>Where to enable it:</b> In the <b>Listings</b> section under your minimum night settings.\n- <b>What it does:</b> Lets guests book short gaps in your calendar without lowering your overall minimum stay.\n- <b>Set your minimum:</b> You can define the <b>shortest stay allowed</b>, like 2 nights. Stays shorter than this won\u2019t be bookable\u2014even in gaps.___________________________________________________________3. <b>Custom Minimum Stays (Date specific control)</b>Want different rules for weekends, holidays, or special events? You can override your default minimum stay for <b>specific check-in dates</b> using your pricing calendar.- <b>Where to set it:</b> Go to the <b>Pricing</b> tab and open your <b>calendar</b>.\n- <b>How it works:</b> Select the dates you'd like to adjust, and set a custom minimum stay.\n- <b>Example:</b> You might require a 2-night stay on weekdays but a 3-night minimum for Friday and Saturday check-ins. This helps avoid single-night stays on busy weekends.\n- <b>Important:</b> Custom minimum stays only apply to the <b>guest\u2019s check-in date</b>, not the entire stay.___________________________________________________________By combining these three settings, you have powerful control over how and when your home is booked\u2014balancing occupancy, guest convenience, and your personal hosting preferences.
