  "article": "Advisors are crucial to the Fairly care team; you're uniquely positioned to help homeowners navigate the process of renting a home as a vacation rental. This is why our advisors are typically real estate agents who specialize in vacation home rentals, or want to specialize in vacation home rentals in your local area. While caretakers help homeowners manage the day-to-day operations of their property, your role as an advisor leverages your existing local knowledge and network. As an advisor, there are many ways you can add value to homeowners:- Assist buyers as they find the right vacation home rental for their goals.\n- Help owners navigate local regulations and assist with the permitting process, thanks to your familiarity with local town and county short term rental regulations. Our team at Fairly can assist you with this as well.\n- Offer advice on enhancing homes to boost their long-term value and booking potential.\n- Leverage your local area knowledge to help owners list and market their properties.\n- Help owners keep their properties well maintained, thanks to your rolodex of service providers including roofers, plumbers, electricians, and contractors.\n- Assist homeowners and caretakers whenever the need arises, ensuring a seamless and supportive experience throughout.As a Fairly partner, advisors share in the ongoing success of each property you add to the Fairly platform: owners pay Fairly a 20% reservation fee for every completed booking, and you'll receive 25% of Fairly's fee for each completed booking. Every single time. As you continue to work with vacation home rental owners, you'll naturally start building a client list with Fairly, turning vacation guests into potential future clients.",
