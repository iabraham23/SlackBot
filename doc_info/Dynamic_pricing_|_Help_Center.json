How does dynamic pricing work?To determine your nightly fare, the pricing algorithm first determines the baseline value of your home, and then adjusts it for daily demand. Base nightly priceBefore evaluating variable demand, the pricing algorithm starts with understanding the baseline value of your home.  To find the median nightly value of your home, it analyzes a plethora of aspects of your property, from parking spaces to pet fees.  These factors can be sorted into four major categories:1. Attributes of your home such as bedrooms, bathrooms, parking spaces, number of guests, type of home\n2. Additional fees you apply to your home such as cleaning fees and pet fees\n3. Booking performance of your home and other short term rentals in your area\n4. Location of your home - whether it is rural, urban, suburbanDemand modelTo determine the daily value of your home, the pricing algorithm analyzes any factor that could impact demand for your property.  This includes:1. Time (day of the week, seasonal trends, local events, holidays) \n2. Proximity to booking dates (last minute booking, far in advance booking)\n3. Demand (current demand, historical demand, predicted demand)\n4. More factors such as vacancy gaps, single home vs multiple homes  These factors are reviewed daily to make sure your home\u2019s prices are as competitive as possible.
