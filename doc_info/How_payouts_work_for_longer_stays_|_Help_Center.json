  "article": "For most reservations, payouts are initiated on the day of check-out. But when a stay is longer than 30 nights, Owner payouts are split into increments so you don\u2019t have to wait until the end of the stay to receive your funds. How it works<b>First 30 nights</b>- After 30 nights have elapsed, we\u2019ll initiate the owner payout for the first 30 nights. This happens on the 31st day of the reservation.\n- The platform fee and applicable taxes are deducted before the payout.<b>Subsequent 30-night periods</b>- If the reservation continues beyond 30 nights, we\u2019ll initiate a payout after every additional 30 nights that pass.\n- Each payout reflects the previous 30 nights of the stay.<b>Final payout</b>- When the reservation ends, the final payout is sent after checkout as usual.How does revenue share and cleaning fees work?- <b>Owner payout</b> \u2192 rent earned for the period (minus Fairly\u2019s 20% fee).\n- <b>Fairly revenue share</b> \u2192 distributed to the Advisor, Caretaker, and Fairly in the same increments. Revenue shares are still paid on the <b>5th of every month</b>, as today, for the previous month.\n- <b>Cleaning fee</b> \u2192 always paid after checkout, once the clean is marked complete.Example scenarios<b>Example 1 \u2014 45-night stay</b>- Nights 1\u201330 \u2192 payout after 30 nights (initiated on day 31 to the owner).\n- Nights 31\u201345 \u2192 payout after checkout.\n- Cleaning fee \u2192 payout after checkout.<b>Example 2 \u2014 90-night stay</b>- Nights 1\u201330 \u2192 payout after 30 nights. (initiated on day 31 to the owner).\n- Nights 31\u201360 \u2192 payout after 60 nights.
