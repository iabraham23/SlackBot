  "article": "1. Why Reviews MatterPositive reviews build trust with future guests and increase the likelihood of bookings. They signal that your home is well cared for and that guests have had great experiences. Homes with strong, recent reviews often appear higher in Airbnb and Vrbo search results, which helps you attract more guests. <b>Benefits of great reviews:</b>- Higher visibility in search results\n- Increased booking confidence\n- Better chances of becoming a \u201cGuest Favorite\u201d on Airbnb\n- Insights into what guests love\u2014or think could improve<b>Improvement feedback from guests:</b>- Pay attention to written feedback and review scores\n- Use it to identify ways to improve the home or amenities\n- Consider updating your listing description to better set guest expectations2. How to Respond to a Review a Guest LeftIf a guest leaves a review about their stay, you\u2019ll have the option to publicly respond through the Fairly platform. This can be a great way to thank them or to clarify any misunderstandings. To respond to a review:- Go to the <b>Performance</b> section of your Fairly dashboard\n- Find the review you wish to respond to\n- Click <b>\u201cWrite a public response\u201d</b> and enter your reply<b>Tips for responding:</b>- Stay professional and courteous\n- Keep it short and focused\n- Don\u2019t argue or get defensive\u2014your response shows future guests how you handle feedback\n- When addressing issues, we recommend only writing a response once the issues have been addressed.

How to Leave a Review for a GuestAfter each stay, you\u2019ll be able to rate and review your guest directly within Fairly. Reviewing guests is a great way to encourage them to also review your home.

You\u2019ll also be able to send a message to the guest asking them to leave you a review and encouraging them to put any improvement recommendations in private feedback.\n2. <b>From the Messaging section</b> \u2013 Find the reservation thread and select the option to leave a review.Keep your review professional, honest, and helpful for future hosts.
