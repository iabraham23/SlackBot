These types of issues are not usually covered by a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. Damage protection powered by ArrkFairly makes damage protection simple by partnering with <a href=\"https://arrk.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Arrk.io</a> to bring you an optional damage insurance program.  In the short-term rental industry, it\u2019s common to add a small guest-paid fee that funds damage coverage.  This gives owners peace of mind: instead of negotiating with guests, you can be reimbursed quickly for covered losses. If you opt in, guests pay <b>$5 per occupied night</b> for insurance.  This cost is automatically added to every reservation, and Fairly handles paying the vendor directly.  We don\u2019t take a cut\u2014just giving you access to better protection, built into your bookings. Each guest reservation comes with coverage for:- <b>$15,000</b> for guest damage\n- <b>$10,000</b> for bed bug remediation\n- <b>$5,000</b> for pet damage\n- <b>$3,500 </b>for loss of useThere is no cost to you as the owner. Arrk damage protection makes the process easier and more reliable.  You can file a claim directly through a simple link without needing to work through Fairly and Airbnb Support.  Unlike Airbnb, which requires involving the guest and creates a frustrating experience, Arrk only requires guest involvement in rare cases like theft.  You also have more time to submit a claim, with 30 days after checkout instead of Airbnb\u2019s 14.  Vrbo does not provide any damage protection, so Arrk gives you coverage that you would not otherwise have. Arrk \u2013 how it works1. <b>Opt in (or out) anytime</b>: You can select damage coverage in your Fairly Listing tab during onboarding, or change your preference later.  Navigate to the Listing tab &gt; Access and policies &gt; Coverage options.\n2. <b>Coverage created for each guest</b>: When a guest books, Arrk issues a policy for that stay.  Coverage starts at check-in and adjusts automatically if the stay changes.\n3. <b>Easy claims process</b>: If something happens, you\u2019ll see a claim link in your Fairly reservation panel \u2013 just click the \u2018Use coverage\u2019 button.  This takes you directly to Arrk, who handles the claim, payment, and any guest coordination.  They will keep you up to date on the status of your claim via the email you provide them.\n   - Your claim must be a <b>minimum of $50</b>.  There is no deductible.\n   - Claims must be submitted within 30 days of the guests check-out date.\n   - Claims can be initiated before a replacement item has been purchased, but the claim will not go into underwriting until a receipt for a replacement has been provided to Arrk. \n   - Guest involvement is only needed if there was theft.\n   - Arrk pays out the reimbursement directly to the homeowner. \n4. <b>Behind the scenes</b>: Fairly pays Arrk the guest fees directly, no need to track anything on your end. Key details- If you opt in after you already have reservations, Fairly will add insurance to those bookings and deduct the cost from guest rent.\n- If you opt out after you already have reservations, Fairly will remove the insurance cost and add those funds back to guest rent.  Guests on those bookings will no longer have coverage.\n- This program is for damage only.  For more on liability insurance (e.g., in case of guest injury), see the <a href=\"#h_e61f65b337\">section below</a>.\n- Only homeowners and owner collaborators are able to manage the preference for damage coverage.If you do not opt in to Arrk coverageWithout Arrk coverage, the path to reimbursement depends on the booking channel:- <b>Airbnb</b>: Claims can be filed through AirCover with Fairly Support.\n- <b>Vrbo</b>: No built-in program; you\u2019ll need to pursue damages directly with the guest.Airbnb damage protectionAirbnb has damage protection for each home on their platform.
