  "article": "<b>General</b>Fairly issues various United States tax documents (\u201d1099 Information Returns\u201d) both to the United States Internal Revenue Service (\u201dIRS\u201d) and Fairly users.  The type of 1099 Information Return you receive depends on your role and the types of payments that you receive through the Fairly Platform.   <b>Tax Document Overview</b>When a user creates a payout profile on the Fairly Platform, Fairly establishes whether a user is a U.S. Person and subject to this 1099 Information Return reporting requirement by asking for certain identifying information and a certification from the user (\u201dForm W-9\u201d).  At the end of each calendar year, Fairly determines which 1099 Information Returns need to be issued based on the details of the Form W-9 and a review of the quantity and types of payments processed through the Fairly platform during the year. In certain cases, if your payments for the year do not exceed certain thresholds defined by the IRS, you will not receive a 1099 Information Return from Fairly.   The table below provides a summary of the 1099 Information Returns issued by Fairly, all of which should be available by January 31 of the year following the reportable calendar year:  The 1099 Information Returns will be issued and made available to you within the Fairly Platform. You will receive an e-mail to your registered e-mail address when the tax documents are ready.  These tax documents will also be filed with the IRS and with state tax authorities (where required).     <b>Resolving Problems with Tax Documents</b>If you are having issues reconciling your 1099 Information Returns to your transactions, or if the personal information on the tax document is incorrect, please send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:tax@fairly.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tax@fairly.com</a>.
