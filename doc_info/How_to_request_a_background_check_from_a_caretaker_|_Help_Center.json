Below are suggested message templates you can use when reaching out: <b>Initial Message:</b><br>\u200b<i>\"Hi [Caretaker\u2019s Name], I\u2019m excited about the possibility of working together. Before we move forward, I would feel more comfortable running a background check, which I will cover the cost of. The process is secure, and the results will only be shared with me. Could you provide me with your email address so I can send you the invitation to complete the check? Let me know if you have any questions!\"</i> <b>Follow-Up Message (if needed):</b><br>\u200b<i>\"Hi [Caretaker\u2019s Name], I wanted to follow up on the background check invitation I sent.
